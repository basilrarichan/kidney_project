The normal range for a packed cell volume (PCV) test varies depending on factors like age, gender, and other factors. Typically, the normal range is:
In females: 35.5–44.9%
In males: 38.3–48.6%
In pregnant females: 33–38%
Overall: 38–52% for men and 34–48% for women 



According to NCBI Bookshelf, the goal hemoglobin level for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less than 11.5 g/dL. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend that the hemoglobin level in adult patients with CKD should not be maintained above 11.5 g/dL. 


A serum creatinine test measures the amount of creatinine in your blood. Creatinine is a reliable indicator of kidney function. Normal levels of creatinine vary based on age, sex, and muscle mass. For men, a normal result is 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL (61.9 to 114.9 µmol/L) and for women, it's 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL (53 to 97.2 µmol/L). 



A normal urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) is less than 30 mg/g. A UACR above 30 mg/g may indicate kidney disease, even if the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) number is above 60


The normal range for specific gravity is 1.005 to 1.030. However, normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laborat
